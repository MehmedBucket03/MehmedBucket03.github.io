      Before you visit however, maybe you'd like a few reasons why you shouldn't visit.

        1) Crypto scams, that are very common, can leave you helpless, exposed, and broke. The scammers use the same techniques as on the regular web, but the lack of regulation means they are less likely to be shut down by ad networks, forums, and other places where the scams pop up.

        2) Exit scams occur when a seller stops shipping products but continues to take orders and money.

        Those should be reasons enough, but if you want more, there is a <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reasons-avoid-dark-web/"> link</a> you can visit.
